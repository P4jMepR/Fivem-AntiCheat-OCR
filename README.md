# Fivem-AntiCheat-OCR
Cheating prevention software for GTA V modification called FiveM.


Fivem-AntiCheat-OCR repo is more about the journey itself other than "ready to use" code since some things were updated and some parts of our project might need a rework for it to work as intended. We still hope that from the code we share people can learn something new or re-use it in new projects.

This project is an outcome of two developers working daily for around 6 months to bring something new and unknown yet to the Fivem AntiCheat scene (https://fivem.net/).

We've introduced a lot of features that made cheating in an online game that much harder. We've combined code that existed (i.e on Github), things we coded fully ourselves and also discontinued projects made by other users remastered by us to make something we would be satisfied with. During our journey, we had to reverse engineer some popular FiveM cheats in order to find something which we might use to detect them and overall make our things more secure.

Since FiveM supports a few frontend languages and a few backend languages as well, it was a full stack project almost all the time, technologies we used for the most part are: Lua, JavaScript (vanilla and node.js), Python, HTML, TypeScript. An API we've made was connecting all parts of our code and was capable of auto-updating, remotely editing, restarting it etc.

As the name of this project might give a hint, one of the features we've used is OCR (Optical Character Recognition) written in Python and it was the first concept we've had about our project. When that part was finished we've decided that we want to add more things and that's exactly what we did. During this project, we've gathered a lot of new experience in technologies we have not used before and also in technologies we've been using on daily basis.

We have also have found several bugs and security flaws in things we've been using at the time (or trying to make more secure ourselves i.e Fivem, since it is OpenSource), we made sure to report them and gladly watched them getting fixed by devs :)
